Mechanics:
- Follows most of the current brewery mechanics
- multiblock structures no longer require signs, because that was kind of dumb
- signs can be used to set tick amount on timer (see explanation 1)

MultiBlocks:
- distillery
- barrel
- large barrel
- advanced distillery
- fermenting machine of sorts (will improve this in a later version of the notes)
- timer (for automation, explanation 1)

Explanations:
1. This allows us to require tick perfection on the recipes making them much more difficult to get perfect(nacre pearl anyone?) making recipes much more
difficult to achieve perfection. This rewards players for successful automation but also makes automating require lots of tweaking to get just right.
